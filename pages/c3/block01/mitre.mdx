# Introduction to MITRE ATT&CK

Understanding the MITRE ATT&CK framework, its components, and its importance in cybersecurity will form a baseline for your knowledge. As members of the Cyber National Mission Force, gaining base understanding of adversary tactics and techniques is crucial for successful operations.

## What is MITRE ATT&CK?

**MITRE ATT&CK** stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge. It is a comprehensive framework that describes the behavior of cyber adversaries during an attack. This includes the methods they use, the tools they deploy, and the tactics they follow.

### Importance of MITRE ATT&CK in Cybersecurity

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is essential for several reasons:

- **Adversary Behavior Understanding**: It provides insights into how adversaries operate, which is critical for defending against and responding to attacks.
- **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: Understanding TTPs helps in identifying and mitigating potential threats effectively.
- **Framework Standardization**: It offers a standardized language and methodology for discussing and analyzing adversary behaviors.

## Key Concepts

### Tactics

Tactics represent the **"WHY"** of an adversary's actions. They are the goals or objectives that adversaries aim to achieve during an attack. The MITRE ATT&CK framework categorizes tactics into several stages, each representing a different phase of an attack.

### Techniques

Techniques represent the **"HOW"** of an adversary's actions. They are the specific methods adversaries use to achieve their goals (tactics). Each technique can be further broken down into sub-techniques that provide more granular details.

## Components of the Framework

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is divided into several components, each representing different tactics and techniques used by adversaries.

### Tactics

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information to plan future attacks.
2. **Resource Development**: Establishing resources for attack, like infrastructure or malware.
3. **Initial Access**: Gaining a foothold in the network.
4. **Execution**: Running malicious code.
5. **Persistence**: Maintaining a presence in the system.
6. **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher-level permissions.
7. **Defense Evasion**: Avoiding detection by security measures.
8. **Credential Access**: Stealing credentials like passwords.
9. **Discovery**: Understanding the environment and its defenses.
10. **Lateral Movement**: Moving through the network to other systems.
11. **Collection**: Gathering information of interest.
12. **Command and Control**: Communicating with compromised systems to control them.
13. **Exfiltration**: Stealing data from the network.
14. **Impact**: Manipulating, interrupting, or destroying systems and data.

### Techniques

Each tactic includes various techniques that adversaries might use. Some examples include:

- **Initial Access**: Phishing, Exploiting Public-Facing Applications
- **Execution**: Command-Line Interface, Scripting
- **Persistence**: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution, Office Application Startup
- **Privilege Escalation**: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, Process Injection
- **Defense Evasion**: Obfuscated Files or Information, Masquerading
- **Lateral Movement**: Remote Services, Pass the Hash
- **Command and Control**: Commonly Used Port, Web Service
- **Exfiltration**: Automated Exfiltration, Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol
- **Impact**: Data Destruction, Data Encrypted for Impact

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will research the NotPetya attack to understand how different tactics and techniques were employed. Each group will focus on one specific tactic and identify at least one technique used by the attackers.

### Group Assignments

- **Group 01 - Initial Access**: Investigate how attackers first gained a foothold in the network.
- **Group 02 - Execution**: Explore how the NotPetya malware was executed within the victim's environment.
- **Group 03 - Persistence**: Analyze methods the malware used to maintain its presence on infected systems.
- **Group 04 - Privilege Escalation**: Understand how NotPetya gained higher-level permissions on the network or systems.
- **Group 05 - Defense Evasion**: Examine the techniques used to avoid detection by security measures.
- **Group 06 - Lateral Movement**: Study how the malware spread through the network after initial infection.

### Research Instructions

1. **Research**: Use online resources to gather information about your assigned tactic and technique.
2. **Document**: Write a summary of your findings, including how the technique was employed in the NotPetya attack.
3. **Present**: Prepare to present your findings to the class.
